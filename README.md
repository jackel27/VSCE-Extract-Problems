# Extract Problems Message Extension

This extension allows you to extract all the messages from the Problems panel in Visual Studio Code and copy them to the clipboard. It doesn't include all the other information that is in the Problems panel, just the messages.

## How to Use

You use it by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), typing Extract Problems, and choosing the Extract Problems Messages to CSV command.
