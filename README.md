# Extract Problems Message Extension

This extension allows you to extract all the messages from the Problems panel in Visual Studio Code and copy them to the clipboard. It doesn't include all the other information that is in the Problems panel, just the messages.

## How to Use

Right click on any problem in the Problems pane and select "Extract All Problems Messages". All the messages will be copied to your clipboard, and you can then paste them into any text editor.
